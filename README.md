Enhancing Traditional Time Series Forecasts with Machine Learning and Stacked Ensemble Methods

## Introduction

In this project, we explore the potential of Machine Learning (ML) to enhance traditional time series sales forecasting models for a company that owns multiple restaurants. The primary goal is to determine if ML algorithms can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of existing forecasting methodologies. Achieving this objective will empower the company's decision-makers to make better forecasts and informed business decisions.

## Overview

This project leverages concepts and skills acquired from the Harvard Data Science courses to address a real-world data challenge. We will utilize a variety of tools and techniques, including but not limited to:

- **R Programming**: For data analysis and model building.
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful visual representations of data.
- **Algorithm Building**: Developing and tuning ML models.
- **Productivity**: Efficiently managing the workflow and processes.
- **Statistics**: Applying statistical methods to understand data patterns.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing and evaluating ML algorithms to enhance forecasting accuracy.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key phases:

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
    - Gathering historical sales data.
    - Cleaning and transforming data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
    - Analyzing data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
    - Visualizing data to facilitate understanding of findings.

3.  **Feature Engineering**:
    - Create informative features to capture the effect that could impact sales.
    - Modify existing features to improve the performance of models.

4. **Model Development**:
    - Building traditional time series forecasting models.
    - Developing and tuning ML models to improve forecasting accuracy.
    
5. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Comparing the performance of traditional models and ML models.
    - Using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and others to evaluate model effectiveness.
